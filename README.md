a Battleships Command terminal game for Python
Users can compete with the computer by correctly estimating the position of their opponent's battleship before the machine locates its own. Each game allows players to choose the number of ships and board sizes they want to use.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
